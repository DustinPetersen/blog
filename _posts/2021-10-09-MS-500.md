##  Implement and manage identity and access

###  Create, configure, and manage identities.

Companies need to think about how to secure those resources, by defining authorized users.  
Companies need to ensure that users only have access to data that they need, that they only create services they are authorized to create, and that they only perform operations they are authorized to perform. 

Every user who needs access to Azure resources needs an Azure user account. 

Azure AD builds an access token to authorize the user and determine what resources they can access and what they can do with those resources.

You use the Azure Active Directory dashboard in the Azure portal to work with user objects.
You can only work with a single directory at a time (Use the Directory + Subscription panel to switch directories.)

## View users

To view the Azure AD users, select the Users entry under the Manage group - this will open the All Users view.
