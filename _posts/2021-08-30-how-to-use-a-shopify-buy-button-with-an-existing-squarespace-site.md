If you’ve built a beautiful website on Squarespace and then realised that a must-have commerce feature is missing, this guide is for you!

Squarespace is one of the best website building platforms available. You can build a stunning website for your business but if you are selling online, you may become frustrated by the lack of advanced ecommerce features. For example:

* Multi-origin shipping
* Multiple pick-up and delivery options
* Different sales tax (vat) rates per product

The good news is that you can pair many (not all!) of Shopify’s features with Squarespace by using Shopify Buy Buttons on your Squarespace website.

The Shopify Lite plan starts at around $9 USD per month. It’s completely free to try this with your Squarespace website. What have you got to lose? Click this link to start a free trial of Shopify and follow the steps below.

How does it work?

If you have a Squarespace website, and you want to take advantage of Shopify features like “buy now, pay later” services, you must either switch to a competitor, such as Shopify, or integrate a competitor’s commerce features with Squarespace.

If you want to stick with your beautiful, well-designed Squarespace site, then one option is to keep Squarespace for the website design features that it offers, and replace all of Squarespace’s commerce features (their cart, checkout, order emails, shipping options, tax management, inventory and so on) with those of Shopify.

Shopify offer a starter solution called Shopify Lite. For around $9 (USD) per month, you can use the core features of Shopify, including their payment options, with your Squarespace website. You’ll be replacing everything in Squarespace commerce with the equivalent feature in Shopify and so the sales workflow will work something like this example (using “bambora”).

# Getting Started

1. Click this link to start a free trial of Shopify. When you click the free trial button, you’ll see the form below, asking you for some basic information – your email address, a new password and a name for your store. The name of the store will be used in all the order-related emails so you’ll want it to match your current Squarespace site.

2. Navigate to the **Products** section or follow the prompts to add a product.

3. Just like in Squarespace, you’ll be prompted for a product title, description, image and price. Add the required information and click the **Save** button in the top-right of the window. Congratulations, you’ve now added your first product to Shopify!

4. In the Shopify navigation, look for the **SALES CHANNELS** section (at the bottom). You should only see one channel called Online Store. Click the plus **(+)** button to see a list of additional Sales Channels.

5. Select the plus **(+)** button beside Buy Button.

6. After a few seconds, **Buy Button** will be added to the **SALES CHANNELS** section and a button will appear entitled Create Buy Button.

7. Click **Create Buy Button**. A window will appear prompting you to what kind of buy button you will create.

8. Select the product you added (by clicking the radio button on the left) and then click Select product. A window will appear with many options on how to customize your button to be imbeded in your Squarespace site.

9. Ensure the Layout Style of Basic is selected. This will allow us to add a button to a product that already exists on our Squarespace website. If you expect purchasers to want to buy more than one, you can go into Layout options and tick Show quantity field.

Note that if your products don’t already exist on Squarespace, you could use the Full view option (instead of the Basic option) to add images of the product, the description as well as the Add to Cart button. However, this isn’t the way I’ve described it in this article. If you do want to use the enhanced option.

10. Check the Action when people click dropdown to see that Add product to cart is selected.

11. Click Next (in the top-right corner).

12. The generated code will appear. Copy the code to the clipboard by clicking the button.

13. Logon to your Squarespace and navigate to the page you would like to add the “Buy now” button and insert a Code Block.

14. Remove the sample code from the Code Block and paste the Shopify code into it.

15. Click Apply and then Save the changes.

16. You’ll now see the Shopify Buy Button below the product image and description.

17. Click the Buy Button and the product will be added to the Shopify cart, bypassing the limited Squarespace cart. From here, customers can proceed directly to the Shopify checkout where they can pay with whatever payment method(s) you have installed in Shopify.

# Adding Payment Providers
To add payment methods to Shopify, click the Settings icon (in the bottom left corner) then click on the Third-party providers link.

Now select whatever payment provider you would like to use to complete the process.
